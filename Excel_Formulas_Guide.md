## Key Formulas Explained

### 1. Total Earned (Column H)
```excel
=F2*G2
```
Multiplies Quantity × Rate per Unit

### 2. Balance Change (Column J)
```excel
=H2-I2
```
Shows the net change: Total Earned - Amount Paid

### 3. Running Balance (Column K) - CRITICAL FORMULA
```excel
=SUMIFS($J$2:J2,$B$2:B2,B2)
```
This formula:
- Sums all Balance Changes for the specific laborer
- Uses SUMIFS to filter by laborer name
- Shows cumulative balance per person
- Positive = You owe them money
- Negative = They took advance

### 4. Payment Status (Column L)
```excel
=IF(K2>0,"Due",IF(K2<0,"Advance","Paid"))
```
Automatically shows:
- "Due" if balance is positive (you owe money)
- "Advance" if balance is negative (they owe work)
- "Paid" if balance is zero
